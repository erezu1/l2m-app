# Epsilon

Turns a LaTeX article into a paper you can read comfortably on a phone.

It works in three separate parts:

| part | what it is | made by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **document** | the paper as data: its HTML, numbering, formulas (as TeX, plus drawn once), figures | `epsilon_convert.py`, the only step that runs LaTeX |
| **theme** | how it looks and what the reading bar offers: `viewer/theme.json`, `viewer/theme.css` | you edit it |
| **viewer** | draws a document with a theme in the browser: `viewer/viewer.js`, `viewer/nav.js` | shared by every paper |

Change the theme (a font, a colour, which buttons the bar has) and every paper follows, without converting anything again. A paper can be read through a site with a library (`epsilon_viewer.py`) or packed into one self-contained `.html` file (`epsilon_render.py`).

- **Numbering matches the PDF.** Sections, equations (including `align` rows), theorems, figures, tables and citations get the numbers LaTeX itself prints. The tool adds hidden `\label`s to a copy of your source and compiles that copy in a temporary folder. Your own files are never changed.
- **Math is drawn once, ahead of time,** with MathJax, and stored with the document, so a paper opens instantly and looks the same everywhere. The TeX of every formula is kept too, so the viewer can draw it itself when needed.
- **Built for small screens.**
  - Tapping a footnote marker slides up a sheet with the note; all notes are also listed at the end.
  - Wide equations scroll sideways, with an edge shadow, while their number stays visible.
  - Theorem-like environments are shaded boxes.
  - Figures and tables open in a full-screen viewer: tap the figure, its expand badge, or any reference to it ("Figure 3"). Inside the viewer, pinch (or trackpad-pinch / Ctrl-scroll) to zoom within the frame, drag to pan, and double-tap to zoom in or back to fit; "Show in text" jumps to its place. Long captions are shortened to three lines with a "More" button, so the figure keeps most of the screen. Opening a figure from a reference does not move the page.
  - Greek text (`\textgreek`, `\textalpha`…, or polytonic Greek typed directly) is set in Noto Serif, because the reading fonts lack accented Greek.
  - The page is never wider than the screen: wide equations, tables and code scroll inside their own box, and long URLs wrap.
- **Reading bar.** Once you scroll past the contents, a slim frosted-glass bar slides in. It has:
  - a back button (it turns into ✕ while the contents panel is open);
  - the title of the current section, which fades to the next one as you scroll; tap it to open the contents panel, attached under the bar;
  - a jump-to-top button;
  - a settings button (also at the top right of the title block): choose the font (STIX Two Text, Literata, Source Serif 4, IBM Plex Sans), the text size (small, medium, large), Light, Dark or System appearance, and a Neutral or Warm tone (Warm has its own light and dark versions). Choices are remembered in the reader's browser, and the reading position is kept when the font changes.
- **Links remember where you were.** Tapping an equation number, a section, a citation or a footnote is a real history step. The browser's back button, or the bar's back button, returns to the exact spot you left, and the target briefly highlights when you land on it.
- **A library.** `epsilon_viewer.py` puts many documents behind one page: a list of papers, each opening in place, with back returning to the list. See below.

## Setup (once)

You need:
- Python 3.8+, standard library only;
- a TeX installation with `pdflatex` and `bibtex`;
- Node.js;
- optionally, `pdftoppm` from poppler, for PDF figures (`brew install poppler`).

```bash
cd epsilon
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 epsilon_convert.py path/to/paper.tex
```

This writes the document folder `path/to/paper.l2m/` (see [DOCUMENT.md](DOCUMENT.md)). To read it:

```bash
python3 epsilon_render.py path/to/paper.l2m -o paper.html
```

packs it with the viewer into one file that works offline. The fonts go inside too (the default reading font, the bar's font and the font list's names, about 0.4 MB, downloaded once from Google Fonts and kept in `~/.cache/epsilon/fonts`); only a font the reader switches to is fetched when chosen. `--html paper.html` on the first command does both at once. Options of `epsilon_convert.py`:

| option | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-o DIR` | the document folder (default: `paper.l2m` next to `paper.tex`) |
| `--html FILE` | also write a one-file page |
| `--artifact` | with `--html`: a page fragment (no `<html>/<head>/<body>`) for publishing as a Claude artifact |
| `--kicker "Draft"` | small line above the title (`epsilon_render.py --kicker` changes it later) |
| `--title "..."` | override the title |
| `--engine xelatex` | use `xelatex` or `lualatex` to obtain the numbering |
| `--no-math` | don't draw the formulas ahead of time; the viewer draws them in the browser |
| `--keep-build DIR` | keep the LaTeX build files (for debugging) |

Warnings about unknown commands, missing references or formulas MathJax could not render are printed at the end. The document is still written; unknown commands keep their argument as plain text.

Try it on the example:

```bash
python3 epsilon_convert.py examples/sample.tex --html examples/sample.html --kicker Example
```

## The theme

`viewer/theme.json` says what the viewer offers:

| key | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `bar` | the reading bar's buttons, in order: `back`, `title` (the section title and contents button), `top`, `settings`, `library` |
| `titleblock` | what sits by the title: `settings` (the settings button), `library` (an "All papers" link, on a site) |
| `fonts` | the fonts to choose from: `key`, `name`, `note`, the CSS `stack`, and the Google Fonts `css` family string |
| `sizes`, `appearance`, `tones` | the other settings and their labels |
| `defaults` | what a new reader starts with |
| `icons` | the SVG icons |
| `greekFont`, `mathjax` | the font for polytonic Greek, and where MathJax is loaded from |

`viewer/theme.css` is the look: colours are tokens at the top, with dark and warm sets; `data-size`, `data-tone` and `data-theme` on the page carry the reader's choices. A new size or tone needs an entry in `theme.json` and its values in `theme.css`. On a site, edit the site's copies and reload; for one-file pages, run `epsilon_render.py` again.

## What is supported

- **Macros and theorems:** `\newcommand`, `\def`, `\DeclareMathOperator` and `\newenvironment` are read from the preamble (and the body). Shortcuts such as `\be`…`\ee` for `equation` work. `\newtheorem` and `\theoremstyle` (plain, definition and remark), shared counters, `\newtheorem*`, `proof`.
- **Math:** `equation`, `align`, `gather`, `multline`, `eqnarray`, `alignat` (starred or not), `split`, `\[..\]`, `$..$`, `\(..\)`, `\tag`, `\nonumber`.
- **References and citations:**
  - `\ref`, `\eqref`, `\autoref`, `\cref`;
  - `\cite` and natbib's `\citep`/`\citet` (numeric and author–year), with references from BibTeX or an inline `thebibliography`.
- **Text and lists:**
  - sectioning up to `\subsubsection`, `\paragraph`, `\appendix`;
  - title, authors (`\and`, several `\author`s), affiliations, `\thanks`, abstract (environment or JHEP-style `\abstract{}`), acknowledgments;
  - `itemize`, `enumerate`, `description`, `\item[...]`;
  - `\emph`/`\textbf`/…, `{\bf ...}`-style switches, accents, dashes, quotes, `\url`, `\href`, `\verb`, `verbatim`, `quote`, `\input`/`\include`.
- **Tables and figures:**
  - `tabular` (booktabs and `\hline` rules, `\multicolumn`);
  - `table` and `figure` floats with captions;
  - `\includegraphics` of PDF, PNG, JPG and SVG files (PDF and EPS are rasterised), honouring `\graphicspath` and `width=0.7\textwidth`-style sizes.

## Limitations

- TikZ/PGF pictures are not drawn; a placeholder marks them. Compile them to PDF and `\includegraphics` the result instead.
- biblatex is not supported; use BibTeX (`\bibliography{...}`) or `thebibliography`.
- Macros that come from a package rather than your preamble are only understood in math, and only if MathJax knows them. Unknown text commands degrade to their argument.
- `\multirow` and complicated table layouts are approximated.

## Tests

`tests/run_arxiv.py FOLDER` converts every paper in a folder of arXiv sources (one subfolder per paper with `src.bin`) and writes `results.json`. `tests/check_viewer.py FOLDER` opens every paper in a site at phone width and checks that it has the same text and formulas as its one-file page and is not wider than the screen (`--browser-math` tests formulas drawn in the browser). `tests/check_docs.py FOLDER` packs each document again and checks the page is identical to the one written at conversion. `tests/check_layout.py PAGES...` loads pages at phone width (390px) in headless Chrome and reports anything wider than the screen. `tests/arxiv-2026-09-24/` holds a full run on one day of hep-th, with a report.

## The reading app and the private library

- **The app** is `viewer/`, published by GitHub Pages at https://erezu1.github.io/epsilon/. It has your library (with search), *New* (today's papers in your arXiv categories, each with *Convert*), the paper view (with *arXiv*, *PDF* and *Keep offline*), and Settings. It can be added to a phone's home screen and works offline for saved papers.
- **The papers** live in the private repo `erezu1/epsilon-library`, which the app reads through GitHub's API with a token typed into Settings (kept on that device only). Make it at GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens: repository access *only erezu1/epsilon-library*, permissions *Contents: read and write* and *Actions: read and write*.
- **Converting** happens on GitHub: the library's *convert* workflow fetches the arXiv source, runs the converter with TeX Live and commits the result (about 3 minutes). The *feed* workflow refreshes `feed.json` every weekday after arXiv's announcement; the categories and whether to include cross-lists are set in the app's Settings (stored in the library's `config.json`).
- **From this computer**, `epsilon_library.py` does the same in a clone of the library:

```bash
python3 epsilon_library.py --library library convert 2609.28331 --push      # an arXiv paper
python3 epsilon_library.py --library library add-draft path/to/paper.tex --push   # your own LaTeX project
python3 epsilon_library.py --library library convert outdated --push       # after improving the converter
```

`add-draft` copies only what the paper needs (the main file, what it inputs, its figures, `.bib`/`.bbl`/`.sty`/`.cls`/`.bst`), converts it here, and pushes; GitHub then sees the draft is already converted.

## A site with a library

```bash
python3 epsilon_convert.py a.tex
python3 epsilon_convert.py b.tex
python3 epsilon_viewer.py build site a.l2m b.l2m
python3 epsilon_viewer.py serve site
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/` for the library, or `http://localhost:8000/?p=a` for one paper. Papers open in place; the back button moves between the library and the papers, and inside a paper it steps back through the links you followed. Adding papers to an existing site keeps the ones already there.

The site is plain static files: `index.html`, the theme and the viewer scripts (copied from `viewer/`), `library.json`, and `papers/<name>/` with each document. Any web server can host it; it must be served over http(s), since browsers do not let a page opened from a file load other files. MathJax, needed only for documents without `math.json` (`--no-math-cache`), is loaded from a CDN, or from the site itself with `--local-mathjax`.

## Publishing as a Claude artifact

- One paper: `epsilon_render.py paper.l2m -o page.html --artifact`, then publish `page.html`.
- A library: `epsilon_viewer.py build site ... --artifact` writes `index.html` with the viewer inline; publish it with the site's other files. An artifact's address cannot carry `?p=`, so a link from outside always opens the library.
